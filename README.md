🚦 Smart Traffic Management — YOLO + LSTM

🧠 A deep learning–powered traffic control system that detects vehicles using YOLO, computes the space occupied by them on the road, and predicts traffic congestion using LSTM, enabling smarter signal timing and traffic flow optimization.📖 Project Overview

🚗 Urban traffic is getting denser every year — conventional systems rely on vehicle count, but vehicle space occupancy gives a more realistic picture of congestion.
This project combines YOLO for detection and LSTM for temporal prediction, using road occupancy (area covered by vehicles) as a key metric.

🛣️ Core Idea:

Detect vehicles 🕵️‍♂️

Calculate road space they occupy 🧮

Predict upcoming congestion with LSTM 🔮

Adjust signals or provide alerts ⚠️

✨ Key Features

✅ Real-time detection with YOLOv5/v8
✅ Occupancy estimation using area occupied in each frame
✅ Temporal prediction via LSTM
✅ Traffic visualization dashboard with live camera feed
✅ Modular pipeline: detection → occupancy → sequence → prediction

📊 Data Requirements

🎥 Input:

Traffic camera video (CCTV, drone footage)

Supported: .mp4, .avi, or RTSP streams

📚 Possible Datasets:

UA-DETRAC

CityFlow

KITTI Vision

Local traffic recordings

⚙️ Occupancy Computation

Steps to calculate space occupied by vehicles:

Define ROI (Region of Interest) for lanes or intersections.

Perform YOLO detection per frame.

Apply perspective correction (homography) to get ground-plane coordinates.

Compute vehicle area (A_vehicle) and lane area (A_lane).

Occupancy = Σ(A_vehicle) / A_lane.

🧮 Formula:

Occupancy_t = (Σ Vehicle_Area_t) / Lane_Area


📊 Smooth over time (moving average) → Input to LSTM.

🧠 Model Architecture
🔍 Detection — YOLO

Backbone: YOLOv5 or YOLOv8 pretrained on COCO.

Classes used: car, bus, truck, bike, etc.

Fine-tune with traffic dataset if needed.

⏳ Prediction — LSTM

Input: sequence of occupancy and vehicle counts over time
Output: predicted occupancy level / congestion class

🏋️ Training

🧩 Pipeline:

Run YOLO to extract detections per frame.

Compute occupancy per lane per frame.

Create sequences (e.g., 60 seconds) for LSTM input.

Train on MSE loss (regression) or cross-entropy (classification).

Evaluate on temporal accuracy of congestion prediction.
